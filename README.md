## Problem Domain
- Our team is in TLI and our project is within the fintech (financial technology) sector.
- We're interested in developing an application which allows users to seamlessly file creditor insurance claims by building a document processing tool which manages PDF integration and processes using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). (Right now the process of filing insurance claims is obsolete and uses fax machines- we're trying to digitize the user journey and cut the time it normally takes).
